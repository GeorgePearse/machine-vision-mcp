## Factors to Consider for Final Decision

1. **Expected Traffic**: How many concurrent users will access the application?
2. **Response Time Requirements**: Does the application need consistent response times?
3. **Budget Constraints**: How much are you willing to spend monthly?
4. **Integration Requirements**: Does the app need to integrate with specific services?
5. **Development Team Expertise**: Which platforms is your team familiar with?
6. **Maintenance Overhead**: How much time can be allocated to maintenance?
7. **Long-running Processes**: Does the application perform lengthy image processing operations?
8. **Scalability Needs**: How quickly might the application need to scale up?

## Conclusion

The ideal hosting solution depends on your specific requirements, budget constraints, and technical expertise. For most small to medium applications, Railway or DigitalOcean provide a good balance of simplicity, cost, and performance.
